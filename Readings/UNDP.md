### 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development

**17 Sustainable Devenoplment Goals (SDGs)** let to attention to income inequality
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

- Avg Gini declined by 3.4 1991-2011, yet SSA remains one of most unequal regions globally,
- 12 countries (predominantly oil and mining sector) recorded inequality rise

### Structural Drivers of Inequality

1. highly dualistic economic structure

        - majority of labour earns much lower incomes (than multinational companies (MNCs)
        and governemnt elite)
    
2. high concentration of capital in certain groups or regions
3. limited distributive capacity of the state
        
        - 'natural resource curse'
        - growth in sectors characterised by "high asset concentration" > inequality rises
        - growth in labour-intensive manufacturing, construction and agriculture > inequality
        falls or remains stable
    
Inequality as biproduct of **regressive taxes**, **unresponsive wage structures** and 
**inadequate investment** in education/health/social protection.

#### Key Equalising Factors:

    - improved distribution of human capital (secondary education)
    - increased direct taxation and efficiency of tax administration
    - enhanced productivity in agricultural sector
    - process of strucutral transformation
    
#### Key Disequalising Factors:

    - rising foreign direct investments (FDI) in extractive industries
        - polarize income disparities
    - suboptimal structural transition of economy from crop agriculture (low inequality)
    to livestock production, commerce, transport (high inequality)
    - unequal distribution of socioeconomic and physical facitlities

#### Additional Questions

- resource dependence <> inequality

        - associated with illicit outflows and weakened governance institutions 
        
- demographic transition: population growth <> inequality
- role of conflict

        - multidimensional poverty -> conflict, yet conflict !-> inequality 
        
#### Misc

- education is key to social mobility but cannot generate jobs needed to takle the 
'time bomb' of the 'youth bulge'

- "eqyal treatment of the 'unequal' promotes prosperity, peace and sustained development"
- policies that help reduce poverty are not necessarily those that help reduce income inequality


#### My Questions

- what is the UN's role in deciding these things -- isn't it a bit colonial in the
patronizing way of 'the west knows best' to decide these things
    - especially when it is clear what a detriment foriegn investments cause
