### Abstract
This project aims to explore the effect of agriculture investment and productivity on the welfare and equitable share of resources in Africa. In this initial version, each country is represented by a vertical bar subdivided into one of the country's top 10 crops. The height of each crop is proportional to the share that crop holds out of the top 10 crops for that country. 

An additional viewing dimension is the metric sorting the countries. Initially it currently defaults "Worker Productivity" measured in 2010 US dollars. The dropdown below the plot allows for additional metrics by which to sort the data. Similarly, one can change the year.

By hovering over a segment, you can see additional information, such as the share a given crop holds out of the country's total crops, as well as the country's value on the current sorting metric. 

Upon clicking on a country, a country specific pane will reveal itself allowing the viewer further context into that country's current agricultural state. A further click on the country vertical bar will bring the viewer back to the main screen.
