                <h4 class = 'subheader'>Gini Coefficient, A Measure of Inequality</h4>
                The gini coefficient is a measure of how equally a nation's wealth is dispersed.
                These can range from 0 - 1 with a 0 expressing perfect equality and 1 expressing 
                total inequality (100% of a nation's wealth belonging to 1 person).
                
                <h4 class = 'subheader'>Case Study: The Color Revolutions</h4>
                Here I explore a wave of revolutions known as the "Color Revolutions" and to see whether there was a consistent pattern of 
                inequality that led up to, and followed these revolutions. Below are all the countries
                with revolutions after 2000 (for which I had access to inequality data) charted over time.

            <!--<p>-->
            <!--    Overall, there does not seem to be an explicitly clear trend common to all these revolutions. -->
            <!--    That said, in many of the cases, the revolution was followed by a significant change -->
            <!--    in inequality (as in Ukraine and Belarus). As there are many reasons for revolution, -->
            <!--    it may be helpful to view inequality as one of many precipitating factors alongside -->
            <!--    corruption, religious differences, and poverty. -->
