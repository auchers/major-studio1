                <h4 class = 'subheader'>Gini Coefficient, A Measure of Inequality</h4>
                The gini coefficient is a measure of how equally a nation's wealth is dispersed.
                These can range from 0 - 1 with a 0 expressing perfect equality and 1 expressing 
                total inequality (100% of a nation's wealth belonging to 1 person).
                
                <h4 class = 'subheader'>Case Study: The Color Revolutions</h4>
                To look at this question, I decided to take a look at wave of revolutions known as 
                the "Color Revolutions" and to explore whether there was a consistent pattern of 
                inequality that led up to, and followed these revolutions. Below are all the countries
                with revolutions after 2000 (for which I had inequality data) charted over time.
